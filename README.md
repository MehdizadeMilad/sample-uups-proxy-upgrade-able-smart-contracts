# Upgradeable smart contract development (Deploy, Bug-fix and adding a new feature)

This project demonstrates how to write an upgradeable smart contract in EVM-compatible Networks;
You can deploy, bug-fix after the deploy, and also add some new features to the smart contract.

- Start with this article [Openzeppelin proxy](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/proxy-patterns/) to understand what is the problem we are trying to solve
- and then continue with this file [/test/upgradeablity.js](/test/upgradeablity.js) to see how you can do it for your needs.



Run tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```
